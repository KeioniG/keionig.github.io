Summary of Discussion on APIs
======
I participated in an academic discussion with my professor, focused on the advantages and disadvantages of using APIs in software development. During the conversation, we discussed how APIs allow developers to access real-time data and integrate powerful external services into applications, saving development time and improving efficiency. APIs were highlighted as an essential tool for building scalable, modern applications, as they allow developers to focus on core functionality rather than recreating existing services. We also examined the potential drawbacks of API usage, including dependency on third-party services, possible downtime, rate limits, and associated costs. Security concerns were addressed, particularly the importance of protecting API keys and handling authentication properly. Overall, the discussion emphasized the importance of using APIs responsibly, understanding their limitations, and planning for potential failures. This conversation strengthened my understanding of how APIs impact real-world application development and the considerations developers must take into account when relying on external services.
