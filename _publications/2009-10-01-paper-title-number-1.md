Project Summary
======
I developed multiple Python-based applications that demonstrate my ability to design functional software solutions and apply problem-solving skills across different domains. These projects include a [TicTacToe game](https://gist.github.com/KeioniG/b3142ae5aee968c8493bbf621e474f99) with artificial intelligence, a [Todo List application](https://gist.github.com/KeioniG/934ba17f47f234385ad09673a243cf03), and a [Weather application](https://gist.github.com/KeioniG/adbc4493f7395b2223d7ccc654ca4829) that integrates real-time data. The Tic Tac Toe game features an AI opponent with multiple difficulty levels, including an unbeatable mode powered by the Minimax algorithm. This project highlights my understanding of game logic, algorithms, and decision-making processes. The Todo List application focuses on task management and usability, incorporating an infinite undo feature through stack-based state management to ensure flexibility and reliability. The Weather application uses a public Weather API to retrieve and display live weather data, demonstrating my experience with API integration, data handling, and user-focused design Together, these projects showcase my growing technical skills in Python, algorithmic thinking, data structures, and real-world application development.
