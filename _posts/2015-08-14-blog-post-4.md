GitHub Portfolio Website – Project Summary
======
I designed and built a fully custom personal portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript, and deployed it using GitHub Pages. The website was structured to clearly present my projects, skills, and background, with a focus on clean layout, consistent styling, and ease of navigation. I implemented a custom theme using CSS variables, incorporated images and custom fonts, and ensured the site was responsive across different screen sizes. The project also introduced me to version control and deployment workflows. I used GitHub to manage updates, track changes, and publish the website automatically through GitHub Pages. This experience strengthened my understanding of web development fundamentals, source control, and static site hosting, while giving me a professional platform to showcase my work and growth as a developer.
