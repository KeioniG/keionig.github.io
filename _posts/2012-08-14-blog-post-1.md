Weather App Project Summary
======
I developed a Weather Application that retrieves and displays real-time weather information using a public weather API. The app sends HTTP requests to the API, receives data in JSON format, and processes that data to present key weather details such as temperature, conditions, and location. By working with external APIs, I gained hands-on experience handling network requests, parsing structured data, and managing potential errors such as invalid locations or failed responses. The application was designed with usability in mind, focusing on clear output and responsive feedback to user input. Throughout development, I emphasized clean code structure and separation of concerns, keeping data retrieval, processing, and display logic organized and maintainable. This project strengthened my understanding of API integration, data handling, and real-world application development, while also reinforcing problem-solving skills and adaptability when working with third-party services.
