Todo List Application – Project Summary
======
I developed a command-line Todo List application using Python that allows users to manage tasks efficiently through a simple and intuitive interface. The application supports core task management features, including adding, listing, and deleting tasks, while ensuring reliable user input validation. The design emphasizes clarity and ease of use, making it accessible for everyday task tracking. A standout feature of the project is the implementation of an infinite undo system, which allows users to revert changes at any point during execution. This was achieved by storing previous task list states using a stack-based history structure, demonstrating my understanding of data structures and state management. Throughout development, I focused on writing clean, maintainable code and organizing logic to allow for future expansion, such as redo functionality or persistent storage. This project strengthened my skills in Python programming, problem-solving, and designing user-friendly applications with robust internal logic.
