Tic Tac Toe Game with AI – Project Summary
======
I developed a fully functional Tic Tac Toe game using Python that supports both human and computer-controlled gameplay. The game features a clean command-line interface and modular design, separating board rendering, game logic, and input handling for better organization and readability. This structure made the game easier to maintain and expand as new features were added. A key feature of the project is the implementation of an AI opponent with multiple difficulty levels. The easy mode uses random move selection, while the medium mode applies rule-based logic to prioritize winning moves and blocking the player. The hard mode implements the Minimax algorithm, allowing the AI to evaluate all possible game states and make optimal decisions, resulting in an unbeatable opponent. Through this project, I gained experience with recursion, decision trees, and game theory concepts. The Tic Tac Toe project strengthened my problem-solving skills and demonstrated my ability to design intelligent systems that adapt to different levels of challenge.
